# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

`.createElement` and node updates for dynamic content generation(user-generated content), fine-grained control, performance optimization, maintainability and security. However, for simpler cases, `.innerHTML` can be a convenient option for dynamic HTML generation and simple content insertion.
