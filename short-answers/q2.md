# Question

Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

HTMLCollections can only contain HTML elements, doesn't work with any array methods, and will be live updated. While NodeLists not only includes html elements and much more, works with forEach() method and can be static or live. They're not arrays since they don't have all the methods and properties of normal arrays.
