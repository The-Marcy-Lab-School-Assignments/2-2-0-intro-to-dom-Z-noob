# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

`.innerText` retrieves content as it appears visually on the page and considers the CSS styling, while `.textContent` retrieves the text content of an element as it is represented in the DOM, without considering any styling or visibility. (`.textContent` is generally faster than `.innerText` because it doesn't have to consider styling)
